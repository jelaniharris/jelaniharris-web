One of the only Google app (apart from Gmail) that I use the most [Google Notebook will have no more updates](http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/google/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=212900775 "Google Notebook stops updates"). Before I signed up to Google I used to keep all of the websites that I thought were useful in my bookmarks and that became really messy really quickly. Also with the useful firefox extension I can now just right click and add to notebook if I ever run across a website that I want to return to later.

Google notebook isn’t perfect. I just wish they would continue making it a better product. But now that I think about it, Google is an company that makes most of it’s revenue selling advertisements online (that I hardly see due to [AdBlock](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865 "Adblock - the only way to use the internet")) and I don’t see how they could’ve made their Notebook app a profitable endeavor. I know that I wouldn’t pay for a “pro” version, and that their ads  would be [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/748)‘d out or plain ignored – all I want is a list of bookmarks not solicitations!

Now I’m going to search online for other alternatives to replace and to transfer all of my bookmarks to. I’m looking at delicious right now – I just don’t like sharing my bookmarks with the world too much. But maybe I’ll let it go once I get my lifestream properly set up on here.
