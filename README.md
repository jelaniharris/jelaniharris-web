This is the personal website for [Jelani Harris](https://jelaniharris.com) that is running on Gatsby, React, Node.js, and Bulma.

The source for this site was not created to be a boilerplate template or theme but was for my own personal use. Feel free to take whatever insipration from this code, but keep in mind that this was not created with the intentioned of being cloned and deployed elsewhere. Thus, I do not provide support or guidance for this codebase.

I recommend that you use the [Gatsby Advanced Starter](https://github.com/vagr9k/gatsby-advanced-starter/) if you want to setup your own blog.
